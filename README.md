## 🧩 Project Development Steps

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Problem
- Identified issues with manual data handling between departments.
- Goal: Build an automated hub for collaboration and student management.

### 2️⃣ Planning the System
- Chose Java for console-based backend system.
- Used MongoDB for persistent storage.
- Used Doubly Linked Lists for runtime management.

### 3️⃣ Setting Up Environment
- Installed Java JDK  
- Installed MongoDB & Compass  
- Configured MongoDB Server (`mongodb://localhost:27017`)  
- Added MongoDB driver JAR files to Java project  

### 4️⃣ Designing Data Structures
- Created `DepartmentNode`, `StudentNode`  
- Created DLL classes for departments and students  
- Designed CRUD operations  

### 5️⃣ Implementing MongoDB Integration
- Created database: `collaborationHub`
- Created collections:  
  - `departments`  
  - `<deptName>_students`  
- Implemented insert, update, delete, find operations  

### 6️⃣ Writing Main Application
- Built menu-driven interface:
  - Add Department  
  - Display Departments  
  - Manage Students  
  - Delete Department  
  - Exit  
- Integrated StudentManagement module  

### 7️⃣ Testing
- Added sample departments and verified in MongoDB  
- Tested student operations  
- Verified DLL and DB consistency  

### 8️⃣ Output Generation
- Captured MongoDB screenshots  
- Captured console output  
- Added images to repository  

### 9️⃣ Finalizing Project
- Cleaned folder structure  
- Added README.md  
- Made GitHub repository public
